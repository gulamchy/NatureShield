    "Description": "Flattened bodies with smaller, wedge-shaped heads. Skin is smooth, olive to brown color with blotches or spots on the back and creamy white on the underside. Front feet are small and unwebbed, while hind feet are fully webbed with black claws on the three inner toes. Has no eyelids, tongue, or vocal sacs.",
    "Information": "The African clawed frog is considered an invasive species due to its voracious appetite, ability to spread diseases, and its impact on native species. It's a highly adaptable and prolific species that can disrupt ecosystems by outcompeting and consuming native frogs and other aquatic life, and by carrying harmful diseases like chytridiomycosis.",

    "Description": "Large, heavy-bodied frog with smooth skin, often brown or green with dark spots or mottling on the back. Their belly is typically white or creamy with dark mottling. A key distinguishing feature is a skin fold (supratympanic fold) that extends from the eye, around the eardrum, and towards the shoulder.",
    "Information": "As a result of their feeding behaviors, all lifestages of bullfrogs prey upon and are able to out-compete native frogs and other aquatic species.  Additionally, bullfrogs are a known carrier of chytrid fungus, which causes the potentially fatal skin disease in frogs called chytridiomycosis.  Chytridomycosis is believed to be a leading cause of the decline of native amphibian populations all over the world and responsible for the extinction of over 100 species since the 1970s.",

    "Information": "Exotic apple fruit pests can damage trees and shrubs, and pose a serious threat to Washingtonâ€™s fruit crops and commercial fruit industries. Apple maggots directly attack fruits such as apples, cranberries, cherries, pears, plums, and apricots, making them brown, mushy, and inedible. Exotic apple fruit pests also may attack other fruit trees, ornamentals, and other desirable plants.",

    "Description": "A submersed aquatic plant that can be rooted or free floating. This green plant has a bottle-brush appearance and can grow nine to 15 feet tall. Upon reaching the surface of the water, the leafy branches create dense mats.",
    "Information": "Brazilian elodea, an aquatic plant, is considered invasive because it forms dense mats that crowd out native plants, restrict water movement, and negatively impact recreational activities and aquatic ecosystems. These mats can also impact fish habitat, disrupt sediment flow, and impede boat movement.",

    "Information": "The presence of this stink bug is concerning for farmers because it feeds on a large number of high-value crops and ornamental plants in its immature and adult life stages. It has a high reproductive rate, a lack of natural predators in its new areas, and can easily be spread by human transportation.",
